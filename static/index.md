Thinking in Cities, to me, is all about seeing our communities through the eyes of history, geography, politics, justice, infrastructure and, crucially, to imagine and advocate for a better world for all of us in the City.

Here, I have my thoughts and ideas on Cities, Urbanism, History, and all manner of other topics. This blog is focused on Cities as a site of Social Justice in addition to how the built environment is set up - and how it should be. Understanding cities, infrastructure, and transportation should bring to focus the people that will invariably interact with, and be affected by, these policies and structures.
