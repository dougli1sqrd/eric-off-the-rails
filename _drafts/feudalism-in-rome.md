**Notes:**
* What were non-Roman cultures like? Did they have anything like feudalism before?
    1. Frankish tradition splits the realm between the sons of the ruler (gavelkind)

        * Were the Franks in feudalism?
        * Where did the gavelkind succession come from? Is that a Germanic thing?
    2. Visigoths elected Alaric I as their first king in 395.

        * Were the Visigoths in feudalism?
        * What does it mean to be king for the Visigoths? Is this a feudal king?
            * Alaric lead troops as allies to Rome to defeat a Frankish army, sacrificing 10,000 men, but didn't get any Roman honors. So he mutinied and was elected King by his people. According to records, he told his people to "seek a kingdom by their own exertions rather than serve others in idleness." This seems to say that Aleric was using the Roman notion of Kingship.
    
* Feudalism maybe came from Roman *Patronage*
    * Generals would envision whole new conquered areas as their patrons. 
        * Augustus apparently deemed himself the patron of Rome
    * *History of Rome Podcast:* He talks about how new conequests brought huge numbers of slaves, replacing the "middle class" farmer-owner. Since moderately wealthy landowners were the only ones allowed to serve, traditionally, the land requirements would be decreased. This allowed more of the dis-landed join the army for money and glory. Additionally armies would be paid. They could then be granted land by their generals in new territory. Lastly, They would be patrons of their general, being more loyal to them, in a sense, than the state that left them out to dry.

# Beginning Questions

From around 500 to 1400 the economic and political system of feudalism dominated. This was a decentralized set of hierachical political relationships tied to land ownership. A lord would grant a piece of his land to a *vassal* in exchange for an agreement of help during war, taxes, food, and allegiance. Furthermore, peasants and surfs would work and farm the Lord's land at a manor, or estate, with few rights and freedoms. They would also be obligated to serve as a part of the lord's army in times of war.

But where and how did this system arise? While we can say that the system arose out of the fall of the Roman Empire, how exactly did this occur? What Roman cultural and social structures became feudalism after the fall of Rome? Why was it these systems?

William the Conquerer in 1066 brought French feudalism to England after defeating King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, leading the way for Capitalism to begin to develop in the 1400s on English farms. Answering these questions is interesting and important as it could shed light on how we concieve of our capitalist society today.
